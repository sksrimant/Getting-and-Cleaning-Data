Used data from the UCI HAR dataset

features.txt (contains the names of all included features)
activity_labels.txt (contains the dictionary of activity_id to activity_label)
X_train.txt (training data)
X_test.txt (testing data)
subject_train.txt (subject ids for training data)
subject_test.txt (subject ids for testing data)
y_train.txt (contains activity ids for each data set in the training data)
y_test.txt (contains activity ids for each data set in the testing data)
Used variables

output: Result data frame that contains the means of all features for each activity and participant
subject_id: The numerical id of the subject taking part in the survey
activity_label: Activity label of the activity carried out This variable is first used as a numerical code and is subsequently translated to a character variable using activity_labels.txt
mean_and_stddev_measurements: A matrix of the means and standard deviations of all parameters measured in the survey
*_idx: Row or column indices used for sorting
Workflow

The workflow of the code mainly consists of three steps (a high-level representation of the 6 steps in README.md):

Load all data

Merge and select data

Aggregate to mean
